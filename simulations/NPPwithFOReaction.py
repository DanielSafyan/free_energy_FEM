NPP simulation with First Order Reaction kinetics at electrodes.

This class extends NernstPlanckPoissonSimulation to include first-order reaction 
kinetics at the electrodes. The reaction follows the form:
    Flux = k * c_surface
where k is the reaction rate constant and c_surface is the surface concentration.
